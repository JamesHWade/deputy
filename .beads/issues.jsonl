We should adopt this pattern for clarity.\n\n2. **Tool Grouping System**: `btw_tools(\"category\")` pattern is elegant. We have similar with `tools_file()` etc.\n\n3. **BtwToolResult S7 Class**: Extends ContentToolResult with structured output. Our tools return plain strings - could consider richer result types.\n\n4. **GitHub API Validation**: Sophisticated endpoint allow/block system with wildcard patterns. If we add GitHub tools, this is a good security model.\n\n### Tools We Could Adapt\n\n| btw Tool | Deputy Opportunity |\n|----------|-------------------|\n| **git tools** (via gert) | Add `tools_git()` - branch, commit, diff, log operations |\n| **documentation tools** | Add `tool_read_help()`, `tool_list_vignettes()` |\n| **environment tools** | Add `tool_inspect_object()`, `tool_list_packages()` |\n| **GitHub tools** | Add `tools_github()` with endpoint validation pattern |\n\n### What NOT to Adopt\n\n1. **No Sandboxing**: btw's `tool_r_run()` executes R directly without sandbox. We keep our callr-based sandbox - it's more secure for untrusted tasks.\n\n2. **chromote Dependency**: btw's web tool requires chromote (headless Chrome). Heavy dependency we don't need.\n\n3. **IDE Integration**: btw's IDE tools are RStudio/Positron specific. Not needed for our CLI-focused approach.\n\n### Recommendation\n\n**Don't depend on btw directly** - different security philosophies. Instead:\n- Adapt their tool description patterns (more detailed WHEN TO USE sections)\n- Consider adding git tools using gert (low effort, high value)\n- Consider documentation tools (R help system integration)\n- Keep our sandbox approach - it differentiates deputy as more secure\n\n### Priority for New Tools\n1. P3: Git tools via gert (most requested)\n2. P4: Documentation tools (help/vignettes)\n3. P4: Environment inspection tools"}
