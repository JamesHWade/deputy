Description: A provider-agnostic framework for building agentic AI workflows
    in R. Built on ellmer, it enables multi-step reasoning with tool use,
    permissions, hooks, and human-in-the-loop capabilities. Works with any
    LLM provider that ellmer supports including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google,
    and local models via Ollama.
